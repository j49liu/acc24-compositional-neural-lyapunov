Code for reproducing the numerical example in the following paper:

- **Compositionally Verifiable Vector Neural Lyapunov Functions for Stability Analysis of Interconnected Nonlinear Systems**, by Jun Liu, Yiming Meng, Maxwell Fitzsimmons, and Ruikun Zhou, presented at The 2024 American Control Conference (ACC 2024).

Dependencies:
- Relies on PyTorch for training the neural network.
- Uses [dReal](https://github.com/dreal/dreal4) for verification.
